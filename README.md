While the UK is a sought-after destination for new beginnings, many immigrants find themselves disconnected from their roots, including their native language and cultural heritage. Our mission is to change this narrative. Through our app, users can practice their mother tongue through lifelike conversations with AI. We bridge the gap between native English speakers from migrant families and their deep roots abroad, offering a platform to reconnect with their heritage using a seamless voice interface and natural language processing technology.

With AI-guided practice sessions, both heritage speakers and language learners can engage in immersive conversations. Users record their voice, triggering AI-driven responses. The app manages conversation flow and preserves history for continuous improvement and practice.
